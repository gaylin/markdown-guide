<p class="lead">The best way to get started with Markdown is to use it. That's easier than ever before thanks to a variety of free tools.</p>

You don't even need to download anything. There are several online Markdown editors that you can use to try writing in Markdown. [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) is one of the best online Markdown editors. Just open the site and start typing in the left pane. A preview of the rendered document appears in the right pane.

You'll probably want to keep the Dillinger website open as you read through this guide. That way you can try the syntax as you learn about it. After you've become familiar with Markdown, you may want to use a Markdown application that can be installed on your desktop computer or mobile device.
