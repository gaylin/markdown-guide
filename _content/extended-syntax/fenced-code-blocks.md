<h1 class="page-header">Fenced Code Blocks</h1>

The basic Markdown syntax allows you to create [code blocks](/basic-syntax#code-blocks) by indenting lines by four spaces or one tab. If you find that inconvenient, try using fenced code blocks. Depending on your Markdown processor or editor, you'll use three tick marks (<code>```</code>) or three tildes (`~~~`) on the lines before and after the code block.

~~~~~~~~~
```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
~~~~~~~~~

The rendered output looks like this:

```plaintext
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
