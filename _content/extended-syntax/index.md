## Extended Syntax

The [basic syntax](#basic-syntax) outlined in John Gruber's original design document added many of the elements needed on a day-to-day basis, but it wasn't enough for some people. Several individuals and organizations took it upon themselves to extend the basic syntax by adding additional elements like tables, codeblocks, syntax highlighting, URL autolinking, and footnotes. These elements can be enabled by using a lightweight markup language that builds upon the basic Markdown syntax, or by adding an extension to a compatible Markdown processor.
