Extended syntax isn't available in all Markdown applications. You'll need to check whether or not the lightweight markup language your application is using supports extended syntax. If it doesn't, it may still be possible to enable extensions in your Markdown processor.

## Lightweight Markup Languages

There are several lightweight markup languages that are *supersets* of Markdown. They include Gruber's basic syntax and build upon it by adding additional elements like tables, codeblocks, syntax highlighting, URL autolinking, and footnotes. Many of the most popular Markdown applications use one of the following lightweight markup languages:

- [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-advanced-formatting/)
- [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)
- [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)

## Markdown Processors

There are [dozens of Markdown processors](https://github.com/markdown/markdown.github.com/wiki/Implementations) available. Many of them allow you to add extensions that enable extended syntax. Check your processor's documentation for more information.
